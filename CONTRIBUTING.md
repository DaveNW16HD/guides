We love pull requests. If you have something you want to add or remove, please
open a new pull request.

## Getting Feedback

Since these are our guides, we want everyone at thoughtbot to see them. We have
a lot of offices across a lot of timezones, so we leave all PRs open for at
least a week to get feedback from everyone.

## Content

Our goal is to set higher-level decisions instead of specific choices, to lead
our team into building the right thing instead of dictating the correct
solution.

Sometimes we just want to know which libraries to use. For that we create
template projects such as [Suspenders].
